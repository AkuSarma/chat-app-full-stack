## **Project Overview**
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a group project to research, plan and develop a Full-stack project - a chat app in 10 days.

### **This Website Features**
- Login functionality
- Registration
- Add/remove friends
- Chat with friends
- Switch chats

## **Setup and Instructions for using the Project**

1. This Full-stack project runs on React and Express. Make sure you have Node installed to run the API and React. We used VSCode for this project.
2. Clone [Chat App](https://github.com/joaopulsz/messaging-app.git) by typing the following commands into your terminal:
```git clone git@github.com:joaopulsz/messaging-app.git```. Open in VSCode.
3. Within VSCode, navigate your terminal to the `express.js_server` folder and run the following two commands:
```npm install```
and
```npm start```
4. Navigate to the `react.js_app` folder and run the following two commands:
```npm install```
and
```npm start```
5. Navigate to your web browser and if it has not already displayed, enter in the following URL:
```http://localhost:3000/```

## **MVP**
For our MVP, we wanted to create a website with maximum functionality which included:

* Register a new account
* Log in an account
* Add a friend
* Chat with a friend
* Switch chats

## **Extensions**

What we have expanded on this full-stack project:

* Add multiple friends
* Multiple conversations
* Unfriend & Delete chats
* Encrypt stored password

## **Further Implementations**
Further functionalities we would like to develop into this website are:

* Group chats
* Pop up window for notification
* Delete Accounts
* Typing bubble
* Account profile picture

## **Acknowledgments**
A special thank you to [BNTA team](https://techacademy.brightnetwork.co.uk/) and especially to Anna, Colin, Ed, Eoan, Phil, Richard and Zsolt, for all the advice and support during the project.
You've made this learning process a blast!

## Default ReactJs Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
